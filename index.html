  <h2>Static Analysis Publications [2009-2019]</h2>

  <h3>Context</h3>
  Static analysis approaches are evaluated using various methodologies like using the benchmarks,test corpus,comparison with existing approaches. This repository consists of the static analysis publications with a detailed evaluation methodology from venues like PLDI,POPL,ICSE,ISSTA,TOSEM, published in the timeline 2009-2019
  
  <h3>Objective</h3>
  The publications in the repository gives a overview on the different evaluation method used for various static analysis approaches.

  <h3>Method</h3>
  We performed a systematic literaure survey based on Kitchenham method by various steps including the data collection, quality assessment, data extraction. The publications are gathered from various important venues in the software engineering.The literature survey was conducted based on the snowballing approach and also key word search. All the publications gathered have an evaluation section giving a detailed description of the method used to evaluate the static analysis approach.

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  The literature survey yielded the following results 
    <ul>
      <li> The most common evaluation methodology for static analysis are using real world applications, microbenchmarks, benchmarks, comparison with the existing approaches.
     <li> The data set size used for the static analysis approach depends on the metrics considered while evaluationg the static analysis.
    </ul>
